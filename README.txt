This repository includes necessary Matlab codes and Simulink model for an interactive sorting application designed to be used with single degree of freedom educational haptic interfaces. The primary intended hardware is a HandsOn-SEA which is a low cost, openhardware, admittance type haptic interface developed at Sabanci University. HandsOn-SEA uses a TI C2000 series microcontroller which has a great Matlab/Simulink compatibility. To start the application, 'pwmset.m' to set certain variables and 'sorting.slx' should be deployed on the microcontroller. This will set up the necessary virtual environment for the application. If the system is operating you will be able to feel virtual springs on both sides of the handle. Following this step, running the 'algorithms.m' constructs the GUI which will lead you through the sorting algorithms.
